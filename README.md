A resource pack that tweaks three textures on the game to be themed around Ultrakill:
The Elytra, Bow, and Crossbow. It also changes bunch of sounds related to those items.

The tweaks are considerably detailed **and most only work with CIT Resewn or OptiFine.**

You can rename the `Elytra` to `High Velocity Wings` to have the texture and model
changed to ones based on the Ultrakill item of the same name.

Sadly, I couldn’t get the 8 little wings to show like in Ultrakill, so I used an existing model with 4 wings over and the 4 others below.

You can rename the `Crossbow` to `Pump Charge Shotgun` to have the texture and model
changed to ones based on the Ultrakill item of the same name.

The Shotgun is a model I found online, features a loading animation with the charge bar becoming from green to red.

You can rename the `Bow` to `Piercer Revolver` to have the texture and model
changed to ones based on the Ultrakill item of the same name.

The Piercer is a texture I found online and edited, made the cylinder on both sides, smaller, and animated, the piece I spent the most effort on. Sadly I can’t figure out how to make the left hand holding of it look normal, it’s offset.

Uppercase on the concerned letters is necessary.

I have also changed the Totem of Undying's texture to the gold coin.

Features should work on most versions after 1.13.

- [Vespidaze’s V1 Elytra](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/ultrakill-v1-elytra-texture/).
This is the base model I used, but slightly improved by fixing a bug in the model.
  
- [Deusphage’s “Marksman” Revolver datapack](https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/ultrakills-marksman-revolver-over-fire-bow-weapons.303851/). I changed it to be the piercer, made the cylinder smaller, and made it spin.

- [Metronovich’s](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/ultrakill-shotgun/) Pump Charge Shotgun. It’s practically unchanged, I just made it swap textures on rename.
  
- [Tzyber](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/tzybergears/) for the SFXs (although the bow shooting and hitting sounds are from ingame/myself).
